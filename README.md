                Scientific Calculator
My project is built to calculate not only arithmetic operation it is built to calculate trigonometry and conversions. I actually decide to make a simple calculator that is used for arithmetic operation as I started working on the project in the process of doing it I got an idea of using more mathematical and preparing a scientific calculator actually there will be lot of mathematical operation but I used only a trigonometry and conversions as the version increases I try to add more operations and more code

Acknowledgements
Thanks for giving me this chance for doing a project with the help of these I was able to use the coding skills that I have learned in my collage and the platforms that are provided by you me to prepare and practice. With the help of all these I implemented a project (Scientific Calculator)
